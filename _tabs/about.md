## Hello!
Hi there, welcome to my blog. The main focus of this site is my homelab, and what I get up to... for better or for worse - I will post about my failures just as much as my successes.

There may also be some non-homelab posts from time to time if I think it's unique or interesting enough to deserve sharing. My partner and I will (hopefully) be restoring an old car soon providing we can get workshop space sorted!

## Who am I?
As a brief introduction, my name is Andrew and I am a Senior Cloud and Infrastructure Architect. I also have a background in DevOps and automation.

Be sure to check out my intro post if you want more details on why I am doing this - [Hello, World!]({% link _posts/2025-03-08-Hello-World.md %})
